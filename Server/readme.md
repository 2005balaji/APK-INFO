# Node.js APK Information Extraction Application

## Features
- File uploads using `Multer` middleware
- APK information extraction using `aapt2`
- Data storage in MongoDB using `Mongoose` library
- Real-time communication with clients using `Socket.IO`

## Usage
The server imports the necessary libraries, creates an Express server with a Socket.IO instance, and listens for incoming connections. Upon receiving an "upload" event from the client-side containing an APK file, the server performs the following actions:

1. Saves the file to disk
2. Extracts the app's details using `aapt2 dump badging` command
3. Saves the extracted details to a text file
4. Reads the contents of the text file and extracts the necessary details
5. Uses MongoDB to store the extracted details.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`
4. Start the server by running `npm start`
