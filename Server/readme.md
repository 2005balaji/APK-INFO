This code is a Node.js application that handles file uploads using multer middleware and extracts information about an Android APK file using aapt2 command-line tool. The extracted information is then stored in a MongoDB database using mongoose library. The application also uses Socket.IO for real-time communication with clients.

The application first imports the required libraries and creates an instance of the express application. It also creates an HTTP server instance using the http module and passes it to the socket.io constructor to enable real-time communication between the server and clients.

The application defines a MongoDB URL and a schema for the data to be stored in the database. It also defines a multer storage configuration to specify the destination folder for uploaded files and a upload object that uses this configuration.

The app.post route is used to handle file uploads. When a file is uploaded, the server runs the aapt2 command to extract information about the APK file and stores it in a text file. The server then reads this text file and extracts various information about the APK file using several functions, each of which extracts a specific piece of information (such as the application name, version name, etc.) from the text file.

Once all the required information is extracted, the server creates a new instance of the schema using this information and saves it to the MongoDB database using the mongoose library.

The socket.io library is used to emit events in real-time to the clients. When the server receives a file upload request, it emits a fileUploaded event to all connected clients with the name of the uploaded file. When the server saves the APK information to the database, it emits a apkSaved event to all connected clients with the name of the application and the package name. The clients can then listen for these events and update their UI accordingly.


The server starts by importing the necessary libraries and creating an express server with a socket.io instance that listens for incoming connections. Upon receiving a connection, the server listens for an "upload" event from the client-side containing an APK file. Once the server receives the APK file, it saves it to disk, runs the "aapt2 dump badging" command on the APK file to extract the app's details and save it to a text file, reads the contents of the text file, extracts the necessary details, and emits them back to the client-side.

The server also contains functions to extract various details such as the app name, version name, version code, package name, supported screen densities, target SDK version, etc., from the text file containing the APK details. Finally, the server uses MongoDB to store the extracted details.

Synchronous functions are those that block the execution of the code until the function completes its task. In the given code, the synchronous functions are:

writeFileSync() method in the socket.on("upload") event listener, which writes the uploaded file to the disk synchronously.

fs.writeFileSync("apk.txt", res) in the socket.on("upload") event listener, which writes the contents of res to a file named apk.txt synchronously.

execSync('cd uploads && ./aapt2 dump badging app.apk') in the socket.on("upload") event listener, which runs a command synchronously using the execSync method.

Asynchronous functions, on the other hand, do not block the execution of the code and instead use callbacks or promises to handle the results of their operations. In the given code, the asynchronous functions are:

socket.on("upload") event listener, which is asynchronous as it waits for the client to upload a file.

exec() method in the CallOutFuntion() function, which runs a command asynchronously and uses a callback function to handle the result.

io.emit("data", alldatas) in the Datas() function, which emits data to all connected sockets asynchronously.

mongoose.connect() method for connecting to MongoDB, which returns a promise that can be handled asynchronously. However, this part of the code is commented out, so it is not being used at the moment.
